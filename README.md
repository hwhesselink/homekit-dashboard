# Homekit Dashboard

Easily make user-friendly dashboards for everyday use of Home Assistant.
The dashboards have the look and feel of the Apple Home app so they're intuitive to use.
They work on Android and Apple devices and in browsers and you can have as many as you like.

Homekit Dashboard is not just a skin or a theme.
Itâ€™s a complete dashboard generator that automatically creates all pages for domains, areas, sensor lists, etc,. all the links, badges and backgrounds, and does all the layout.
The dashboards automatically follow all changes to your Home Assistant configuration so that adding or deleting devices and entities, moving them between areas, changing names, backgrounds, etc. is immediately reflected in the dashboards.

Dashboard creation is easy, just a few clicks.
They can be used as-is, or each dashboard can optionally be configured independently so you can:

* Give everyone their own dashboard, or multiple dashboards each with a different function
* Set up personalized, limited, locked-down dashboards for the kids, for staff, for guests
* Give kids a dashboard with their own background for their room but no access to the their sibling rooms or the master bedroom :smile:
* Make per-room tablets, or per-floor

The per-dashboard configuration is stored as YAML with each dashboard.
This keeps it separate from your Home Assistant configuration so that it's easy to manage large numbers of dashboards because
Home Assistant changes don't require dashboard updates.
And because it's YAML you can easily make templates, version-control your dashboards, etc.

Homekit Dashboard makes extensive use of Home Assistant areas and labels ("On Home View", "Favorite", "In Summaries") and other settings.
Areas drive dashboard creation, only entities assigned to an area are included in the dashboard.
Labels determine what entities are included on the home page and in badges.

Homekit Dashboard works out of the box: 3 lines of YAML are all you need to create a complete dashboard populated with assigned entities.
If you've not yet configured areas you need to do this once for the first dashboard, see [Populating the dashboard][populateURL] in the wiki.

# Configuring Homekit Dashboard

The [installation][installationUrl] wiki page goes into detail, including how to install without HACS, but tl;dr to get a bare dashboard up and running if you have [HACS][hacsInstallUrl] installed:

1. Install dependencies:
    - _Mushroom Cards_

    [![Open in HACS at your Home Assistant instance.][hacsBadge]][mushroomCardsHacs]

    - _Card Mod 3_
  
    [![Open in HACS at your Home Assistant instance.][hacsBadge]][cardModHacs]

    - Any desired [optional cards][installOptCardUrl] for extra functionality

1. Install Homekit Dashboard

    [![Open in HACS at your Home Assistant instance.][hacsBadge]][homekitDashboardHacs]


1. <a name="readme-restart-home-assistant">Restart Home Assistant:</a> go to `Settings`, click the 3 vertical dots at the top-right corner and select _Restart Home Assistant_ from the drop-down, click _Restart Home Assistant_ and then _RESTART_

1. Go to `Settings->Dashboards`, click on _ADD DASHBOARD_ and create a new/empty dashboard from scratch

1. In the popup fill in the _Title_, leave the rest as-is and click _CREATE_

1. Click the _OPEN_ button on the newly-created entry in the Dashboards list

1. Click the pen icon at the top-right corner of the dashboard

1. Click the 3 vertical dots at the top-right corner of the dashboard and select _Raw configuration editor_ from the dropdown

1. Replace the text that appears with:
   ```yaml
   strategy:
     type: custom:homekit-dashboard
     views: []
   ```
   
   then click _SAVE_ and then the _X_ at the top left corner of the editor window to close it (you may have to click the _X_ twice)

10. Click the _DONE_ button at the top right

You now have an empty home page "My Home" and no badges.
[Populating the dashboard][populateURL] explains how to add entities by assigning areas and labels.
The [configuration page][configurationUrl] explains how to change the home page name, default background and other settings.

If you already have entities assigned to areas they should show up in one of the other (non-Home) views, otherwise those views will also be empty.

The new dashboard should show up in the Companion App.
If it doesn't you may have to clear the frontend cache (on the device) by going to `Settings->Companion app->Debugging` and clicking _Reset the frontend cache_.

NOTE: by default the sidebar and overflow button are hidden on mobile devices if you have Kiosk Mode installed,
so if you're installing via a mobile device once you open the dashboard there will be no way to exit.
See [Kiosk Mode configuration][configureKioskUrl] for how to override this **before** installing via a mobile device.
