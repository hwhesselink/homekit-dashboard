## Additional dependencies
These can all be installed via HACS or manually, see their Github pages.

### Card-mod 3
Allows styling and tuning various elements of the dashboard using CSS.
Use HACS to install or see https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod.

### Mushroom card collection
Almost all the cards used are mushroom cards.

### Kiosk mode
This is optional.
It allows extra control of the layout of the dashboard.
If installed it will by default remove the unused overflow button for everyone as well as hiding the sidebar and menu button for non-admin users.
